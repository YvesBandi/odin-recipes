    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet consectetur, adipisicing elit. Quod aliquam illo iusto impedit quam culpa cupiditate voluptas vel porro quasi! Commodi corporis rerum vero porro rem aliquam aspernatur, quasi autem!</p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>360 g spaghetti (12-13 oz) I used spaghettini from Pastificio dei Campi</li>
        <li>2 garlic cloves peeled</li>
        <li>600-700 g ripe date tomatoes (21-24 oz) You can also use canned whole date tomatoes or San Marzano tomatoes. see notes</li>
        <li>salt to taste</li>
        <li>fresh basil as required</li>
        <li>2-3 tablespoon extra virgin olive oil</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Instructions</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Blend half of the whole tomatoes and pass through a sieve to remove the skin and seeds. Then crush the other half using a fork and pass through the sieve as well. You will obtain a fairly watery tomato sauce but it will thicken while cooking.</li>
        <li>Peel the garlic and cook in the olive oil until it starts to soften. Add the tomato sauce and cook for about 5-10 minutes over a medium heat.</li>
        <li>Add the uncooked spaghetti to the sauce. Be careful not to try to stir too roughly as the spaghetti may break. Once it softens you can then cook like risotto stirring frequently.</li>
        <li>The starch from the pasta will thicken the sauce. If it gets too dry add a little water. Cook until the spaghetti is al dente. Add salt to taste and serve immediately with some fresh basil leaves and grated cheese if required.</li>
    </ol>
